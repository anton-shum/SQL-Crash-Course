# SQL Crash Course

## Intro

Hi, here are the tasks that I was solving when I started to study SQL. Its cover the basic functionality of the  Structured Query Language. 

I did everything in PostgreSQL. Next there will be instructions for local installation.

### Prerequriments

-  Unix-like OS ([Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/))
- IDE for SQL (I use [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/) but you can also in the terminal)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Preparation

Let's do a little preparation of the environment.

## PostgreSQL installation

The database will work in docker, this makes installation very easy. In order for the PostgreSQL to become available on port `5432` with credentials `root`:`root` and database name equal `db`, go to the directory with the [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) file and run the following command:

``` bash
docker-compose up -d
```

  ### PostgreSQL connection

To work with PostgreSQL, you need to connect to it. To do this, you need to do the following:

1. Select in the settings, connection to PostgreSQL.

2. Enter data into the form.

3. Check the connection.

### Database initialization

After all the programs are working correctly, you need to create a database.

1. Select in the settings, New Database.

2. Enter the name for the database.

3. Open its console.

4. Enter the [script](init.sql) that initialize the database.

WHERE is_done = 0
```

#### 5. List owners of dogs

```sql

LEFT OUTER JOIN Pet ON Pet_Type.Pet_Type_ID = Pet.Pet_Type_ID
```

### 3

#### 1. How many pets are there at age 1 year, 2 year, etc.?

```sql
SELECT Age, COUNT(*)
FROM Pet
GROUP BY Age
```

#### 2. How many cats, dogs, etc. aged 1 year, 2 year, etc. ?

```sql
SELECT Age, Name, COUNT(*)
FROM Pet
JOIN Pet_Type ON Pet.Pet_Type_ID = Pet_Type.Pet_Type_ID
GROUP BY Age, Name
ORDER BY Age ASC
```

#### 3. Pet breeds with an average age of less then 6 years

```sql
SELECT AVG(Age), name
FROM Pet
JOIN Pet_Type ON Pet.Pet_Type_ID = Pet_Type.Pet_Type_ID
GROUP BY Name
HAVING AVG(Age) < 6
```

#### 4. Last names of employees who completed more than five orders

```sql
SELECT Last_Name, COUNT(*)
FROM Order_Info
JOIN Person ON Order_Info.Employee_ID = Person.Person_ID
